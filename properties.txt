LTLSPEC G(ue_is_connected -> !ue_cell_info_bad)
LTLSPEC G(!ue_cell_barred)

---Old properties from SMF state machine

---Discovery may only complete after discovery was initiated
---LTLSPEC nrf_discover_completed -> O(nrf_discover_requested);

---The state can only change to chf_selected once one of the methods has succeeded
---LTLSPEC has_charging_identifier -> (pcf_provides_address | udm_provides_characteristics | nrf_discover_good | has_local_CHF_charactaristics)

---If a PDU init happens, we will always eventually get the CHF identifier (deliberately has counterexample)
---LTLSPEC incoming_pdu_init -> F(has_charging_identifier);
